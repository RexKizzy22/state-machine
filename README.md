## How to Run Scripts

1. The only prerequisite to run scripts in this repository is to have the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) installed

2. Once the .NET SDK is installed, you can then run a script in the F# interactive terminal (fsi) with the following command:
   ```bash
    dotnet fsi <name-of-script>.fsx
   ```
3. Optionally, you can run a block of code by highlighting the code block and pressing ```ALT + return``` keys.

4. You can also run a line of code by placing the cursor on the line of the code and pressing ```ALT + /``` keys.
